The following questions are provided as useful starting points for facilitating post-moderated research conversation (for example, after a [stakeholder or user interview]({{ "/methods/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/" | url }}), or a [usability test]({{ "/methods/validate/usability-testing/" | url }}). We recommend copying the questions to collaborative writing tool and giving the team four minutes per section to respond, and then facilitating a section-wise discussion. GSA Staff, please see this [Google Doc Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5Ue2vbeg4-95EevvlURzvl6yMLwMOXtiNwe6OMnb9E/edit#).
