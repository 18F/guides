As Product Managers at 18F, we adopt a user-centric approach to our work.  We value understanding who may be affected or impacted by our work, what their current experience is, and what their needs are so that our teams are focused on solving problems for them.  We bring together the voice of the user with an understanding of our partners’ business, technical, and regulatory needs to help our partners develop a vision for improving service delivery and meeting the goals of their mission.  We work closely with a cross-functional team, made up of user experience researchers, developers, and other subject matter experts (SMEs) in acquisitions or security, to plan and conduct discovery so that we draw on our respective areas of expertise while ensuring everyone is building empathy.
