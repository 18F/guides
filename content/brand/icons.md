18F uses a customized version of [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for its iconography. Feather Icons is [licensed under an MIT License](https://github.com/feathericons/feather/blob/master/LICENSE), with copyright belonging to Cole Bemis.

## Design Specs
Most of the icons retain the base styling of Feather icons. The 18F version includes a few adjustments.
* Icons are drawn on a 48x48 grid, with some custom detailed icons drawn on a 64x64 grid.
* Strokes of 2px, centered, with capped ends.
* For square icons, a min width or height of 28px.
* For circular icons, a min width or height of 34px.
* Minimum of 2px between elements.

## Get the icons
You can access a set of common icons in the [18F Google Slides template]({{ "/brand/templates/" | url }}) (only available to GSA staff), or [download the full set]({{ "/assets/brand/dist/18F_feather.zip" | url }}).

The download includes:
* Searchable PDF sticker sheets of [all 300+ icons]({{ "/assets/brand/dist/18F-Feather-Icons--all.pdf" | url }}) and [top requested icons]({{ "/assets/brand/dist/18F-Feather-Icons--top-hits.pdf" | url }}). Icons with a "--c" name are customized.
* SVG and PNG exports of all icons, by color.
