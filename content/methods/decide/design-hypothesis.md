  title: Design hypothesis
  what: |
    <p>Framing your work as a hypothesis means no longer just thinking about the thing you're making or building, but paying more attention to whether that work is achieving your intended goals and outcomes.</p>

    <p>This in turn means thinking about your work as a series of experiments you do with your users to learn if you're on the right path. Instead of asking "Did we ship the shopping cart feature?" you ask: "Did we make it easier and simpler for our customers to buy from us?"</p>
  why: When done collaboratively, hypothesis-building is powerful at getting a team on the same page about what it’s doing and why. It also allows the team to be flexible &mdash; if one approach doesn’t result in the outcome you expected, you have implicit permission to change course and try something else.

## How to do it{#how-design-hypo}

1. As a team, identify and make explicit the problem you’re trying to solve. What goals or needs aren’t being met? What measurable criteria would indicate progress toward those goals?

1. As a team, write out the hypothesis for the work you want to do to address the problem(s) you’re trying to solve. You may want to write broad hypotheses at the outset of a project and more specific hypotheses each sprint.
    <p>
      Here’s a common way to structure your hypothesis:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>We believe that doing/building/creating [this] for [this user] will result in [this outcome].</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>We’ll know we’re right when we see [this metric/signal].</em>
    </p>

1. Once you've formulated your hypothesis, consider the following harm prompt to help the team think about and guard against potential unintended consequences of your work.

    <p>
      <em>But, this could be harmful for [this user] if [this outcome happens].</em>
    </p>

1. Identify a user touchpoint that will allow you to test your hypothesis, such as external marketing, the homepage, a microsite, or something else. Test your hypothesis. If you learn something unexpected, refine your hypothesis, test again, and continue to work incrementally towards your goals.
