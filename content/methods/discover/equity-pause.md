## How to do it{#how-equity}

  1. <b>Make time for it.</b> This can be an individual reflection or team conversation.
  1. <b>Create a safe space.</b> This includes keeping the conversation private, focusing on understanding others rather than being understood, and accepting the conversation may not offer closure.
  1. <b>Identify an outside facilitator.</b> This role helps your team focus on the discussion. The facilitator is also responsible for maintaining a safe space for discussion. This includes things like ensuring people’s opinions are respected, everyone has an equal chance to speak, and that the conversation remains confidential.
  1. <b>Some prompts for discussion:</b>
     - How might our project goals create or perpetuate harm?
     - What power dynamics might be influencing our work?
     - Who are we not hearing from? Why?
     - What are our biases?
     - Are we acknowledging the history of the government and tech industry’s role in this space?
     - Are we building relationships with our partners? Our users? Each other?
     - How might we make our processes more inclusive?
     - What would we like to say that hasn't been said?

## Considerations for use in government{#con-equity}

Equity pauses are important to do as government employees. This is because of the U.S. government’s history of creating and perpetuating oppression. Without reflection and action, we can unintentionally favor some people over others.
