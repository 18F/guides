18F uses a customized version of [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for its iconography. Feather Icons is [licensed under an MIT License](https://github.com/feathericons/feather/blob/master/LICENSE), with copyright belonging to Cole Bemis.

## Design Specs
Most of the icons retain the base styling of Feather icons. The 18F version includes a few adjustments.
* Icons are drawn on a 48x48 grid, with some custom detailed icons drawn on a 64x64 grid.
* Strokes of 2px, centered, with capped ends.
* For square icons, a min width or height of 28px.
* For circular icons, a min width or height of 34px.
* Minimum of 2px between elements.

## Get the icons
You can access a set of common icons in the [18F Google Slides template]({{ "/brand/templates/" | url }}) (only available to GSA staff), or [download the full set]({{ "/brand/assets/dist/18F_feather.zip" | url }}).

The download includes:
* Searchable PDF sticker sheets of [all 300+ icons]({{ "/brand/assets/img/18F-Feather-Icons--all.pdf" | url }}) and [top requested icons]({{ "/brand/assets/img/18F-Feather-Icons--top-hits.pdf" | url }}). Icons with a "--c" name are customized.
* SVG and PNG exports of all icons, by color.
* A sketch file of all icons for designers.

## Representing humans
In order to offer more diverse and expressive ways to represent humans, we created a custom set of 18F Avataaars based on [the work of Pablo Stanley](https://getavataaars.com/). These are great stand-ins for showing emotion and to represent anonymous user groups.

These are available to GSA staff in two formats:
* Via the [starter deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CXXvxBbVjO3LjIUwRYEbk8WHpsG0AJdUc6SI_jAZDNQ/edit#slide=id.g5fdac3c814_0_209), which includes 10 characters and a range of emotions as well as guidance on different ways to represent humans. You can also get to this starter from the [18F Google Slides template]({{ "/brand/templates/" | url }}).
* Via the [full sketch library](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MFGWlJ6Z1ZzIVXK0h0Xh8RsUiBZzYdbg) for designers.
