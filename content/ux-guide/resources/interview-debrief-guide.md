The following questions are provided as useful starting points for facilitating post-moderated research conversation (for example, after an [in-depth interview [18F design methods]](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) or a [usability test [18F design methods]](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/usability-testing/)). We recommend copying the questions to collaborative writing tool and giving the team four minutes per section to respond, and then facilitating a section-wise discussion. GSA Staff, see this [Google Doc Template (GSA/TTS Access only)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5Ue2vbeg4-95EevvlURzvl6yMLwMOXtiNwe6OMnb9E/edit#).

## Warm-up (4 minutes)
- What stood out about this interview?
- What are this participant’s goals? What matters to them?
- What are their challenges or unmet needs?
- What stories did this participant tell?

## Concept test or demo (4 minutes)
- What goal or task-oriented stories did this participant tell?
- What words did the participant use to describe what they shared?
- What aspects of the participant's task performance went well?
- What aspects of the participant's task performance went poorly?

## Retrospective (4 minutes)
- What about this session reminded you of past sessions (if applicable)?
- What went well about this session?
- What went poorly (for example, uncomfortable topics, awkward transitions, etc.)?
- How might the interview guide (or, if applicable wireframe or prototype) be updated before the next session?
