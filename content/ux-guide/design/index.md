This section covers prototypes, how they inform our work and what prototypes help us convey. It contains resources to get started prototyping with our website publishing platform, [Cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/), as well as information and resources related to the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)— the set of website standards agencies should use per the 21st Century IDEA.
